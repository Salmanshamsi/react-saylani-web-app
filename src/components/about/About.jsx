        <pre>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no
           one and nothing, instills upon his men to give Qarz-e-Hasana
            because it is in manâ€™s nature to be frugal whilst spending 
            his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz because it is returned and
             Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds
             . Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the 
             Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth 
             in a certain way. He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with 
             your wealth. If you do so, no fire, flood or thieves will be 
             able to rob you off your money. Instead, you will be endowed 
             with your wealth when you most need it. He further says that 
             the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due 
             to the negligence of the rich, </pre>
